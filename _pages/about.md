Currently a PhD student at the Paris School of Economics and the Coll√®ge de France, I am working on the potential role of innovation in reconciling economic growth and ecosystem conservation. Passionate about economics, my work is not only empirical (I study in particular economic phenomena in the Amazonian forest) but also theoretical: I rework economic growth models inspired by the recent work of Pr. Partha Dasgupta.
